# Client-distribution-system-via-Round-Robin-Algorithm
# Start
#  All incoming leads are added in a queue and will be served on the basis of their arrival
# time(FCFS)
#  The scheduling system will keep track of;
# 1. L= No. of leads entering the system
# (Help in accountability)
# 2. A= No. of available sales team members
# (Help in assigning leads and managing algorithm)
# 3. M1 to Mn = No. of leads taken by each sales team member
# 4. Q = Quantum Time
# 5. B= Burst Time
#  Leads will be round robin among the available sales team members
#  The burst time and the time quantum of each lead will be compared
